      <p>Every missed appointment is a lost opportunity â€” especially for clinics, salons, and independent professionals. Traditional calendars simply mark the space as "empty" and move on. But what if you could act in real time and fill that gap automatically?</p>
      
      <h2>What is a Last-Minute Gap?</h2>
      <p>A last-minute gap is an unfilled appointment slot caused by a late cancellation or no-show. These gaps represent a loss of potential revenue, disrupted schedules, and wasted preparation.</p>

      <h2>How Gaplets Solves It</h2>
      <p>Gaplets is designed to detect these empty slots instantly. It then looks at your waitlist or upcoming clients and sends automated SMS or email invitations to fill the spot. No manual work, no extra tools.</p>
      <ul>
